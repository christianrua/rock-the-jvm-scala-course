  /*differences between traits and abstract classes
  abstract classes can have have abstract and non abstract members. abstract means not implemented.
  this is also true for traits.
  so the main difference is:
  1. trait do not have constructor parameters
  2. multiple traits may be inherited by the same class
  3. we choose a trait vs a abstract class if it describes a type of behavior.
  traits = behavior
  abstract class = type of "thing"
